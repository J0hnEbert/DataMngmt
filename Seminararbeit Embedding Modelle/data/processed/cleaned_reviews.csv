Cleaned Review
a store that doesnt want to sell anything i registered on the website tried to order a laptop entered all the details but instead of charging me and sending the product they froze my account demanding various verification documents i sent them over they said they would review them within 24 hours in reality its been a week and no one can help or give any truthful estimate of when it will be resolved they just tell me to wait ive never seen such a horrible marketplace in my life i hope those who came up with this cant buy food in a store receiving a document review request that takes forever to process
had multiple orders one turned up and had multiple orders one turned up and driver had to phone as no door number on packaging then waited all day for second package to get a message saying couldnt deliver as no number on packaging 12 hours waiting in now dont even know when im getting delivery terrible will never use again
i informed these reprobates i informed these reprobates that i would not be in as i was going to visit a sick relative they told me they were going to send a otp i told them i could not receive it as i was travelling a long way on the underground their reply was dont worry we can text i pointed out i cant receive texts eitherthey said parcel was on its way so couldnt stop it i pointed out i would not want it as i had permanently closed my accountthe driver came whilst i was out and failed to even follow my settings info that said to deliver to a specific neighbour if i was out since then my account has now been deleted
advertise one price then increase it on website i have bought from amazon before and no problems being very happy with the service and price amazon advertise the product at 6123 us as soon as i logged in and tried to buy two of the items they were 8675 for eachthere is no way of contacting customer service ive spent an hour going round and round in circles very disappointing i would leave a negative star review for the customer service and what i consider to be really poor advertising 
if i could give a lower rate i would if i could give a lower rate i would i cancelled my amazon prime in february and subsequently found that they had continued to charge me when i contacted them they refused to give details of who had set up the payment as i didnt have prime membership at that time my credit card company cancelled the payment for me and refunded the payments made in june i have just discovered that amazon prime has set up payments again without me being a prime member i have had to cancel my credit card to stop themdo not trust amazon prime 
terrible i had to hang up and call back  terrible you get customer service reps that are clearly home you hear children and family scenarios in the background these people lie when asked if they have a quiet environment to work in and i get minimal help if they speak english well enough
yet again  amazon has a way of tainting a great product due to their inability to separate used goods from the new i received a great name blush today that was so obviously used i cant even fathom why amazon does this and it is done often so it is not a mistake i wish i could send you pictures of the product i received and amazon wants you to purchase primeoh yeah 
i love amazon i love amazon i use it for half my shopping the prime membership is worth it as you can receive free 2day shipping on most purchases the online store also has almost anything you can think of ranging from toiletries clothes to electronics and furniture
i applied for a job with amazon i applied for a job with amazon i completed all the steps including sending confidential data and personal information when i attended the prehire appointment at the scheduled time no one was on the other end of the video callso i tried to speak to someone at amazon to reschedule this but due to language barriers with the amazon call handlers this has been very difficultwhy cant you lot have a phone call interview it really is the utmost rudeness when i have sent everything amazon asked for promptly and fully and your recruitment team cant even answer a video call at the scheduled time and why cant i get through to speak to someone who can understand what im saying im about to withdraw my application if the recruitment process is this disorganised then i hate to think what the jobs like
i had a great experience with their i had a great experience with their customer service they delivered my order to wrong address but didnt give me hassle of finding the item instead they said they will take care of it and replaced my order
every time there is a problem every time there is a problem they fix it i have no idea why amazon is so poorly rated here because they provide incredible customer service and support
amazon aggressive marketing is counter productive i have no interest in signing up to amazon prime when making a purchase despite clicking the button not to sign me up i could not stop amazon from providing a 30 day free trial i followed the instructions to remove the trial without success as the instructions took me to a page where there was no evident way to proceed with the cancellation 
bad experience trying to buy a pitboss grill bought a pitboss kc grill combo and received one that was previously opened and was damaged tried to file for a return immediately and received intimation that i would have to take it into a pitboss service center nearly 140 miles away nasty service from such an highly respected company 
sadly sadly amazon no longer provides the quality customer service they once did ive had several orders never delivered and they always ask if i checked neighbors homes etc this is not my responsibility my last missing order actually says the driver handed it to the resident i live alone and was at work at the time of the delivery they insisted that i need to wait another 24 hours to see if it mysteriously shows up if it was still coming why do i have a tracking that says the delivery was handed to me they are also very inconsistent with delivery times when you call customer service they just dont care this company is not standing behind its products or deliveries its time another company jumps in the game with good customer service
extremely disappointed in the customer extremely disappointed in the customer service provided by the driver in van lc21 xbn at approximately 130pm today i suggest that you review the vans footage on how he verbally assaulted me by calling me an fxxking bxxxh as a result of him causing an obstruction in a residential street and being asked to move i have spoken to the customer service team but my expectation of this being treated as a serious complaint is low
right shambles my bank card froze only with amazon so couldnt order anythingpackage said delivered at the post office when it hasnt beenspoke to customer services about my card and he was very short with me and patronising when he was telling me how to take my bank card off then re add it 
fraudulant behaviour  i put onw star because i cant leave a zero i ordered an item for 5999 it arrived on  time but wasnt suitable so i sent it back  it was refunded to my gift card account  which i didnt  requesthowever  as i was going to order a replacement item i didnt realy question it as i was still going to spend the money the 2nd item arrived and was also not suitable   so i returned this as wellthe refund has been at least 2 weeks now and ive still not received it  but had an email saying it will be coming and going into my gift card account this is not what i wanted  this is my money and after two phone calls lasting over an hour theyre  all saying theres nothing they can do  amazon are fraudulently holding  my money  it should be refunded to my credit card but that say they wont cand do thatthis is theft amazon has dropped lower than some dodgy market salesman 
tired of delivery time lies once again my delivery is late with a message saying were so sorryim so tired of this company lying about delivery times absolutely nothing shows up when it says it will im starting not to think that prime is worth it i can get free delivery pretty much anywhere
amazon is garbage  amazon is the garbage company  when it comes to refund anazin will steal your money  give you bs they will escalate it to an appropriate team  itll take 2 business days for someone to get back but no one does ever you call back again  they tell you the same bs if you complain they will transfer you from one dept to another until youre tired amazon just doesnt give money back for returned items theyre the worst co when it comes to returns they give you such a hard time you dont want to shop there again anazon is crook dishonest shady lying manipulating harassing company stay away and dont give this billionaire owner to take advantage of you 
i bought running boards for my jeep and i bought running boards for my jeep and they sent me ones that have already been used so when i called them in what ever country their customer service in and was told they would be replaced it took another week to get what i had already paid for now i have been trying for over a week to have the used ones picked up and they keep telling me they will get not i am on the phone with their co called customer service again trying to get this package picked up
 show of a company  i think ill be cancelling amazon prime after this latest debacle nothing seems to work in this hell hole of a country i had previously given amazon a good review which was taken down because im a computer program apparently but since giving the good review amazon have decided that they can get away providing a substandard service bringing them in line with rest of the detritus operating in britain today i am becoming very weary of online shopping in this country it has become a time consuming nightmare and i have never once been offered compensation for the time stolen from me as a result of their rank and outright incompetence
amazon refuse a review from my account bought a aimoonsa 64gb mp3 player previous had failed after several months use this one has proved impossible to upload music  amazon refuse to allow myself to place a review of the product on their site rather suggestive of the dubious company ive always thought amazon to be
amazon customer service has gone amazon customer service has gone downhill for years the latest thing these  customer service representatives are doing is tell you we cant help you so were gonna terminate the call and then hang up how is this customer service at all
amazon is trash amazon has continuously ripped of millions of peoplepromising 2 daysame day etc and cant performthen when you say something they want to give you 2 dollars for your two years worth of late or absent orderthey are ridiculous 
they lie about shipping times they lie about shipping times promising delivery on a specific day and never receiving it items being lost or not shipped prime is also a joke making promises they cant keep and then being a jerk about it when you complain 
enter at your own risk  i ordered 200 dallors worth of items from amazon i reached out repeatedly for help being 1 product from my order was not delivered the guy says they wont refund  id just reorder it anyway duh i wanted it  or replace it  as well if you try this method online it requires you to send back original product if i did not ever receive the product  how do i send it back  in the matter of 10 minutes he did a through investigation and sees that it was delivered due to weight of package and stamp and whatnot i feel ups delivery guy made a mistake or amazon didnt  package it for delivery in the first place  but im out 71 dollars and am thinking twice about ordering from amazon or shipping with ups 
customer service is very poor customer service is very poor with someone called genean being very cheeky and straight up ending the support chat
no matter what you write in your email no matter what you write in your email request to customer service  they will not read a word of it the will send you machine generated garbage with couldnt help anyone9 times in a row i emailed the same elaborate email they came back with the same unhelpful garbage  obviously did not read my mail 
diff to contact  cant solve simplest of issues many orders completed with no issue needed a photo frame  located one in stock  but system flatly refused to deliver to any address or pick up and provided no reason why 45 minutes to find cs number  cut of twice appaling lines after another 45 minutes cs unable to identify issue fed up with being left on hold so ended call contacted the manufacturer direct ordered the frame  same price but paid a bit for delivery and advised their sales team they could be losing sales due to amazons system how good any business model is is really identified and defined by how it deals with brand and customer support  issues as a long time prime customer i am appalled at amazons woeful system of uncontactable cannot communicate with  cannot understand tick box customer support it is of the very worst kind
amazon delivery system is complete rubbish amazon products are great but their customer service and delivery process are totally useless and worse for those functions than any other company that i know my wife and myself have severe mobility problems and it is dangerous for us to try to pick deliveries from the floor of our front porch which is what we have to do when amazon throws our parcel on the floor take a picture and then run without even ringing the bell it is not possible for me to complain on line and long winded calls to some customer service appears to be a complete waste of time without positive result  it look like i will need to take my business elsewhere
goodbye amazon goodbye amazon you have also sent your customer service overseas and as usual it sucks our family is done with you 
i ordered a phone case from amazon and i ordered a phone case from amazon and the case wasnt even the right one it took so long to deliver and now these prcks havent even giving me the right one fck amazon
no packaging often buy through amazon and never really have any problem  have had drivers leave parcel at front door in full view of the road and then return to van without even knocking or ringing the bell but still surprised at all of the negative reviewsmy complaint with my recent order is the fact it did not come in any packagingtrainers for my adult son arrived with no packaging at all just in their shoe box which was not even taped downthe lid was actually openi had left a note on door to say please leave over gate if im out so glad i was back home as it was pouring with rain and would have had sodden box and shoesguess this is down to the seller
this company may have quanity but not this company may have quanity but not quality and customer service is pathetic try to resolve an issue cant gotta talk to the computer this is not customer service but hey bezos enjoy that new gulf stream while your customers goes elsewhere for there goods 
amazon locked my account amazon locked my account no idea why sent an email saying that after completing form which i did they would be in contact within 24hrs i had no access to prime or amazon music while it was on hold  after 26 hours i attempted to contact themno callback service available so i found an american number and was transferred to a call centre  i was told that it would now be 48hrs   no explanation refused access to a supervisor or information about the complaints procedure   i could hear someone in the background instructing the call handler to finish the call i was on the phone for over 36 minutes after being told several times to wait 2 minutes   this is not customer service as they claimed  i wont be wasting my time with them again and will go back to shopping in the more traditional stores 
i ordered 2 sets of cushions i ordered 2 sets of cushions each set had 5 numbers of cushionsthe delivery guy just delivered 1 set only the stupid unfriendly app does not have any place to capture it inspite of putting it in product review and delivery review no one from the company is interested in resolving my concern i rated 1 star because there is no scope to score less than that here
i have ordered spray glue through i have ordered spray glue through amazon the item arrived damaged and unusable reading customers view with similar problem the seller wont pay for return the item tried to write view about this item the message i received from amazon was  this account has not met the minimum eligibility requirements to write a reviewamazon policy sweep the dirt under the carpet
i will never get prime again i will never get prime again when i pay for prime i expect an order within days not months the customer service stinks with amazon
very poor service for the last 2  3 weeks the amazon delivery driver has not been complying with delivery instructions he leaves parcelspackages outside my front door even in the rain does not ring the doorbell  drives offive complained to the customer service centre 4 times to no avail on my front door is an a3 sign saying please leave packages in the unlocked porchamazon has no control on who it employs  does not give training
they should verify what sellers are they should verify what sellers are selling a solar panel of 10 by 20 cm can never be 50wp as an examplesolarchargers of type mppt that are not that type at all bad performances not every buyer is an expertand all these rubbish sellers are bad for amazon despite amazons good delivery procedures
unrivaled prices and stellar customer service as a seasoned amazon customer for nearly 30 years im compelled to express my unwavering admiration for this company that will rule the world amazon consistently offers the most competitive prices across a vast array of products ensuring that shoppers can always find the best deals but what truly sets amazon apart is its unparalleled customer service the staff is incredibly responsive knowledgeable and dedicated to resolving any issues promptly and efficiently whether ive encountered a problem with an order had questions about a product or simply needed guidance amazons customer support team has always exceeded my expectations they go above and beyond to ensure satisfactionamazons commitment to customer satisfaction is evident in every interaction i have always felt confident and supported when shopping on amazon i highly recommend amazon to anyone seeking a reliable and customercentric online shopping experience 
get so fed up with amazon get so fed up with amazon  i pay annually for the privilege of free next day delivery etc nine times out of 10 i get to checkout and find that the goods offered as next day delivery could actually be any number of days even weeks away  today ive been waiting for a small package which should be delivered by 10pm its now 920pm and tracking shows its not even despatched  amazon customer disservice robot says it will  be delivered today although they only have the same information that i  have tomorrow i  shall receive the usual its been delayed email from amazon and i  will refuse to take delivery when it eventually arrives theres no compensation for lost or delayed items we pay for a poor unwieldy service   not good enough amazon
customer support is horrible the worst customer support is horrible the worst in the industry their phone support went to shxxt i will cancel my prime and deal with another companyamazon rather than farm their out support do not deal with them
delivery instructions dont mean anything to amazon if i could give amazon a zero i would i have a po box so i filled out amazons delivery instructions but they cant seem to follow the hours of operation of the ups store where my po box is located they have tried to deliver 13 of my orders after the ups store was closed since january im done with amazon prices arent as good anymore and since im driving to thr ups store to pickup my packages it isnt saving me money ever since they stopped using ups and fedex to make their deliveries their service has sucked
horrible company now i bought a rv exhaust fit cover i bought a rv exhaust fit cover canceled it same day because it was the wrong one ive been told two times its going to be there back in my account the 1405 in 3 to 5 days called back after 3 to 5 days told the same thing now i called back im told that it was never charged even though im showing it right here on my bank account has charged and was told twice it was coming back amazon just effectively stole my money theyve gone to trash company 
they charged me for items i returned and it is nearly 1000 worth of stuff i am blown away some of these were ups pickups from the house too they do such a poor job of tracking your returns i have tallied up nearly 1000 worth of returns that they charged me for even though i returned the items many in their original packaging or with original manufacturer box that it came in i am going to figure out how to get away from amazon and rid it from my life i cant believe how much they have stolen
absolutely useless absolutely useless wants credit card details for payment before anything happens no other payment options such as paypal or any of the others we have here in australia definitely avoid stick with better online auction buying platforms 
1 product reviews are mostly bots and 1 product reviews are mostly bots and they dont care2 they dont ever pack my stuff right ive had to return 2 things in the past month alone3 if you leave an honest review about a company and the company doesnt like it they will have it removed4 the way they treat their employees is laughably terrible
soooo annoyed with amazon rubbish soooo annoyed with amazon rubbish delivery service placed an order yesterday delivery due today paid premium delivery cost and now on a saturday night ive got to wait until between 8pm and 10pm its saturday night and i cant go out will be using other online services from now on sooo angry even tried calling customer services and just got through to a daft chat bot can some young entrepreneur reading this please come up with a better more efficient solution service that not only looks after its staff but also provides a better delivery service  take it to dragons den  really two printer cartridges and ive potentially got to wait until 10pm on a saturday night  urrgggghhhh
refuse to refund me what a horrible experience with amazon where they refuse refund you when you bought an item they send you the wrong item out and when it comes to getting a refund they just keep saying 7days now this item wasnt even the same brand was a cheap 16inch one where mine was 18 inch monster not going into detail of how much but it was expensive if you been in the same situation before what did you do because im getting no where ive also spoken to them on the phone and they hung up on me twice this conversation has happened every 7 days since the 16th july just going round in circles
my product was left on the street porch my product was left on the street porch where anyone could pick it up and steal it i was at home all day waiting for this but the person handling my delivery never bothered to even ring the door bell or anything just left it outsidei am very disappointed in such service if it wasnt for the email notification letting me know my parcel had been delivered i wouldnt have know to look for it as fast as i didi highly recommend not using their delivery services they are the worst
amazon has the worst delivery service i amazon has the worst delivery service i have ever experienced their coordination and communication are severely lacking i provided a designated delivery schedule for my order during office hours as no one is present to receive packages at night despite this they attempted to deliver my order at night when no one was available even worse they threaten to leave the package outside the office i strongly advise against leaving items unattended it creates unnecessary risk they continue to make promises and apologies saying it wont happen again yet the same issues persist the information in the app often doesnt match reality i placed an order but there has been no update on my delivery despite my followup inquiries as a prime member my experience has been disappointing it feels like there is no priority for members overall i am incredibly frustrated by their service and it seems that they do not care about their customers at all
another delivery left in the street package was delivered but i didnt hear a knock on the door and only noticed the email half an hour later the email said the package was handed to me but was left on the pavement outside my propertyluckily it was still there and not taken by anyone
custumer service in the uk so good custumer service in the uk so good my dad wrongly ordered something to my adress we got refunded in a matter of seconds use the customer service chat in the future if you need something
more lies from this company and thier more lies from this company and thier couriersi was in the front garden at the time it was said to be delivered no sign of any delivery all day utter lies i will never use amazon again i have deleted everything to do with them criminal company
seal plush amazon i made a purchase of a seal plush that was viral on the internet instead of going to the website they made it i went to amazon service and quality were both good
yikes terrible yikes  terrible customer service  ordered 6 bottles of vitamins and only 1 arrived  took a video of unopened bag clearly showing sealed and only 1 bottle inside  after wasting 40 minutes chatting to an agent told i need to return for a refund which may take 12 months  instead of just sending the missing bottles  crazy
racist behavior i have a foreign name and yes i am foreign but that does not excuse the abysmal behavior of amazons customer representative after being connected to an amazon agent she asked for my name once i said it she immediately transferred me without asking to a spanishspeaking representative  and i do not speak spanishwas she instructed to assume that all foreigners are latinos or that none of them speak english or were those her own biases either way this episode reflects terribly on amazon
brilliant service  i cant fault their delivery service from the purchases ive made ive had one occasion where they sent the wrong item  they were fantastic in lockdown and still continue the same service customer service is excellent too 
customer service is circular customer service is circular frustrating and completely unhelpful even ringing the company directly requires you to log in on a computer or phone which is impossible to do if that is the issue you are ringing about intentionally and maliciously obtuse
my account was hacked last night my account was hacked last night ive tried six times now to get a call back from customer service every one has been cancelled i was going to write more  until i saw what a dire score amazon have got on here already onlookers  be warned
amazon have zero control over 3rd party amazon have zero control over 3rd party sellers they take no responsibility for orders despite being charged for shipping i had to pay additional to the courier company to receive the order as 3rd party seller chose a shipping option that didnt cover delivery door to door i then received an open box product which was not mentioned and again amazon did nothing to send the order back i need to pay again for the shipping again amazon did nothing absolutely disgraceful
unreliable service and pricing discrepancy i typically dont take the time to share reviews but my recent experience with amazon has been deeply frustrating and deserves to be addressedas an hvac business i rely heavily on timely and reliable deliveries i placed an order for a 16 duct which was crucial for one of our ongoing projects the order came with a guaranteed delivery date that amazon failed to meet after several unsuccessful attempts to reach amazon with no accessible customer service contact numbers or direct support options i was forced to contact the thirdparty seller directly the seller assured me that the product had been dispatched on time and advised me to resolve the issue with amazon despite being provided with a phone number that i could not find anywhere on amazons platform i eventually managed to speak with an amazon representative i was informed that the product had been lost and while a refund was issued the real issue remains unresolvedi need the material not just a refund when i attempted to reorder the product i discovered that the price had increased by 150  an unjustifiable increase given the circumstances i explained the situation to the representative emphasizing that i had already quoted my customer the original price and could not go back to them with an unexplained price hike in summary my experience with amazon has been one of misleading pricing unreliable delivery and a lack of customer support this has caused significant delays for my business and damaged my relationship with my customeri expect amazon to resolve this by honoring the original price and ensuring the prompt delivery of the productsincerely  alex garcia  attic crawl inc
excellent shopping experience on amazon ive been using amazon for several years and it consistently delivers a great shopping experience the website is userfriendly making it easy to find what i need quickly from books to electronics the variety of products is impressive the customer reviews are helpful in making informed decisions and ive found the delivery to be fast and reliable in the rare instance ive needed to return an item the process was smooth and hasslefree overall amazon provides convenience and value and i highly recommend it to others
account hold  closed with no explaination  i submitted every document they requested and they reply me with we closed your account they said contact customer service if i think this was a mistake but the thing is there is no customer service if i dont have an account gotta do better uncle jeff
excellent customer service seems to be a thing of the past you could say a lot of things about amazon but historically they have had very good customer service this seems to no longer be the case ive wasted an hour and a half on an online chat and a phone call had to repeat myself many times and was given inaccurate information  total waste of time in the end they gave me a 5 gift card in recognition of my poor experience which i found a bit insulting under the circumstances
i placed a order september 9 2024 i placed a order september 9 2024they said i get it on september 12 on the day delivery day i get a text saying the delivery day has changed to september 18this is not going to work for me i am a prim member and i have to wait this long well i dont want it then but i have wait until september 19 to return it i can understand the next day this is not the way to do business 
i returned a product using my amazon i returned a product using my amazon prime card product was return and a refund should have been issued to my prime card but no they went and issued me a gift card without any notification through mail email or account never sent me a code or card in case i wanted to use my funds to my balance what kind of service is that if i would have used my bank card or any other credit card how would have my funds been returned i went to make a quick purchase again using my prime card and the site went using my gift card without giving me an option on my card now that i innocently used the gift card they dont want to send me a gift card or apply remaining balance to my account where it should have been placed from beginning how unprofessional and frustrating this is when any time there is a return it is to be given back to the card used not how ever they chose if i would have paid cash then yes i can understand a gift card but no cash was used i want my funds added to my account or a gift card sent out that can be used to make payment to my card what horrible service amazon is giving 
amazon india the worst customer service amazon india the worst customer service company compared to amazon anywhere else in the world agents are bloody third class idiat they know nothing and they will waste ur time understanding ur problem amazon india is selling duplicate products they dont offer hassle free refunds i purchased a table fountain from themand the day i opened the box it was defective they agreed to pick up the unit the next day as expected they did not and when contacted they put a status that customer refused to the deliver the product just see these idiat then when i contacted them they said investigation is on and it will take another 4 days to resolve the issue after 4 days when in contacted these rascals they are saying that their investigation is complete and nothing is wrong and they cannot helpwith the refund what should i say now just see their bloody service they should be taken to court for cheating and fraud moral of the story do not i repeat do not buy expensive products from amazon better go to a showroom and get one u can feel touch and get a view of the unit and decide with amazon u will face a hard time third class e commerce site never to buy again

today september 4th 2024 finding out today september 4th 2024 finding out that your amazon employees have rigged alexa to actually say when asked about donald trump that they cant comment on politics but when asked about kamala harris they go into a whole bio this is absolutely disgusting  this will definitely influence my buying from you people you probably dont give a damn whether i buy from you or not but hopefully theres others that feel the same way disgusting
amazon failing ordered august 30th the first one for an elderly relative who can no longer hear the phone ring nurses cannot get a hold of him daily amazon said it got lost then empty promises from amazon customer service and supervisors waited and then decided to order another on amazon my profile specifically says open 730 am to 900 pm that delivery person tried at 612 am hello read your instructions ps that one is now lost again amazon customer service is useless3rd time they said tomorrow it is now september 5 2024  think they exceeded their business model walmart target and ebay are quicker and now carry almost everything 
retailers arent reading about operating temperatures for outdoor electronics i bought outdoor water timers for garden and yard from amazon and the cheaper foreign brands have failed so did many of my plants i read the manuals and they say that the maximum operating temperature is less than 110 degrees fahrenheit amazon wouldnt refund my money i reached them by phone and told them that amazon needed to discontinue selling products that are not rated to be used in regions that experience higher temperatures than stated in product manuals this is going to be a huge problem in the future plastics electronics and other temperature sensitive outdoor products will degrade or stop working and retailers should make operating temperatures a basic factor in choosing products to sell to consumers in 2024 phoenix arizona had 64 days when temperatures were 110 or above lawnmowers outdoor equipment hoses lawn furniture and other products will have to be modified to withstand higher temperatures or they are going to fail or wear out much sooner than in the past geologist in arizona
they dont care about their customers i purchased a 10 cpu cooler the seller was amazon themselves i shouldve gotten the fan itself thermal paste  backplate but all i got is the fani was suspicious the second i realized i just got a fan but i thought maybe its supposed to be like that its not and then i applied thermal paste on my cpu and tried screwing the cpu cooler down but it didnt work i need the backplate to screw it downthere is no option to actually contact support i can either get my money back or a new product both options require i send the product back i do not get compensated for the expensive thermal paste of my own that i usedim writing this part a while later i have sent the package back to where it came from you can check on dhlse this number 7135563356i also have a receipt where it said im returning this from dhlthey took a while to update anything for the first nine days it said i havent even dropped of my package yet but i have i got my money the next daydont give amazon the benefit of the doubt like i did just buy from websites with convinient money back policies i told the manufacturers about amazon toowhat should amazon have done send either a whole product the missing parts or give me my money back without requiring me to ship the item back
replacement for tablet under warranty  i have had nothing but problems with amazon for over a month where i sent a fire tablet back to them to be repaired under warranty but then they decided to replace it but 6 weeks later i still have not received a replacement so i am now 100 down for a tablet i aint got 
17 rating at this time of this review 17 rating at this time of this review really i have no problems with amazon there is a huge selection the price is generally lower but not always shipping is great and returning things is easy i am very concerned about alexa though it is extremely biased which is a huge concern as people stop doing research and rely on these devices to tell them what is truthi would also add that allowing chinese products that follow neither the metric nor standard measuring systems should be indicated in a list or else the seller gets a warning 
awful delivery service  drivers dont bother knockingringing the bell even when youre clearly in left 500 worth of electronics at the end of my drive next to the pavement of a busy road wont be using again 
if i could give zero stars they would if i could give zero stars they would get the worst piece of shiiiiit in the univers ordered a megazord power ranger robot in april and somehow they dont manage to get it to me seems like i cant even get a refund now  dont buy your stuff on amazon its shi shi shi end of freaking tour written by peter 
terrible they dont care if they lost terrible they dont care if they lost your package terrible refund  replacement policy if they see that a fulfillment center lost my package they should contact the facility who lost my package or send a replacement if they already know it was lost doesnt make any sense this company has working employees that are nothing but thieves and customer service is horrible always telling u to wait instead of them fixing the problem knowing if they already lost a package from dbk4 fulfillment center my tracking show no update and they already know my package was lost they love to make people upset honestly terrible company tracking tba315683138460
absolutely horrible service and quality absolutely horrible service and quality of items no regard for customer satisfaction of sense of responsibility for customer satisfaction does not want to give refund for faulty poor quality items and are the absolute worst at helping customers with issues bought a backpack that started breaking just less than a week after use and the refuse to grant me a refund thats is so unacceptable and disgusting 
absolutely terrible user experience absolutely terrible user experience in eu36 month delivery time on standard items dispatched by amazonand impossible to get in contact with customer service probably they have no such thingfurthermore the site is flooded with chinese crap  and im not sure how to see what is copies and what is real branded productsupdate sep6th although amazon still completely ignores me they have now seemingly shipped the majority of the order  so only one item remains with looong delivery time at least that indicates to me that someone is reading the feedback and is indeed considering it ill give them a star based on that assumption alone
i have been a prime member since 2016 i have been a prime member since 2016 in the years the service has increased in price something else i noticed since lockdown i can find most items i buy on amazon cheaper elsewhere even when i include shipping the only advantage prime has is the speed of delivery most of the time i can get it next day pretty soon it wont be worth it disappointed 
this company is dirty  corrupt not only does the owner own the washington post where they regularly print lies and take all the real facts out of context theyre alexa is rigged for the democrats and then all of the sellers on that platform get taxed 30 of everything they sell so amazon is like a mafia style bully with marxist witt
have amazon no sense of responsibility for sub suppliers i never use amazon because of a bad experience several years ago hair dryer burst into flames and amazon didnt want to know however my daughter has used amazon consistantly being reasonably satisfied however experience this week has changed her opinion she ordered a power washer when it arrived the cardboard box it was in appeared to have been opened and very roughly resealed on opening the box two of the main components were missing namely the gun and handle on phoning amazon we were told that we had to deal directly with the supplier complaining about this after over 40 minutes on the phone we got a promise of a refund we asked for that to be confirmed in an email email arrived stating we had to deal directly with supplier phoned back but got nowhere you would have thought that considering the disgraceful condition the washer was delivered in amazon would have wanted to be involved
amazon is absolute rubbish amazon is absolute rubbish  forces you to create an amazon account to use the apps on the tv then blocks the account to verify payment details you submit the details then they tell you that you have to wait 2 days to have access to the apps on the tv again  cannot watch netflix youtube nothing because the amazon account has taken over everything on the tv which is blocked  what a joke  deserves no stars at all for such incompetence 
accused of being untruthful upon not receiving packages  i purchase a lot from amazon being easy for next day delivery and they always have what you want  the street i live in is  street leading to  street  hence there is 2 streets with the same door number  the delivery drivers get confused and often deliver it to the wrong house  i have gone to the other house in numerous occasions and been advised they do not have any parcels for me  the photos of the delivery are not even of my property or that of the other house with the same number  im sure the drivers have stock photos anyway  upon contacting amazon i am more or less accused of steeling due to the amount of missed parcels and me requesting refunds or replacement  i received an email with their return policy  again making me out to be an untruthful person and basically i found this quite offensive  i reluctantly purchase  from them now and receive delivery to a locker ensuring that i receive them  the 2 nearest lockers are in the coop shops that close at 900pm this can be difficult to do when you work shifts  basically my complaint is the delivery drivers need to take more care  plus amazon should look into this and not accuse customers of being untruthful  rant over sorry 
yesterday i bought kids rubberband for yesterday i bought kids rubberband for 280 rsthe way the product is showed in the image was satisfactory for mebut today when i got delivered it was too smallnot happy with the productshining diva fashion is the product name 
amazon delivery service gets worse by the day amazon just does not have the customer first anymore since covid the delivery service has got worse and worse you pay for prime you get promised 2 day next day delivery when you make your transaction then its delay here new delivery date you contact customer support all you get is we are sorry when will customer service understand i dont want your we are sorry i paid a premium cost for a service and you did not provide why am i not refunded my prime membership if you cannot deliver on your promise what i have to do is wait till the package eventually turns up the service has got more expensive and and less reliable  need walmart and the likes to pick up and take the crown amazon is not the cheapest so im paying more anyway companies just need to deliver on there promises and im jumping im not loyal to amazon anymore they treat customers like cash cows
auto generated refund incorrect and i cannot get my refund this is the second time i have returned an item and amazons automatic refund is more than what i paid  i get an error when i check refund status and refund cannot be processed  i call multiple times including talk to so called supervisors that cannot fix this issue and process my refund  i am getting sick of not getting this resolved and no one from amazon can fix their auto generated refund system to refund my return  amazon makes sure to charge you the minute it ships out but does not care enough for their customer service to refund when it is shipped back  i am highly disappointed with amazons lack to help get me my refund due to their computer glitch
i pay for prime i pay for prime my items always say they will arrive same day or overnight it seems most orders lately are late or delayed so why do i pay for prime if i am going to get the item in the same timeframe as if i didnt amazon also leaves no way for you to communicate issues other than to pester people who have no control over that situation hope something better comes along so they can go away 
 amazon prime is great value i have used amazon prime for years and absolutely swear by themthey are wonderful if any problem arises which dosent happen often  they sort it  immediately  recently something i bought which i thought was a book for 1099  turned out to be just a pamphlet i complained to amazon and they immediately  refunded my money and i didnt have to go through the hassle of returning it so i gave it to the red cross amazon is always ny first choice when buying online because i know my purchase is safe with them unlike paypal where your money is not safe and is not returned to you when the seller turns out to be a scammer amazon deserve their  good reputation they are  terrific
unreal unreal  to begin i used to be a staunch amazon defender  that became lessso when they continued to send me items which were usedreturned broken literally leaking nonworking and just plain the wrong item  still i shopped them for the convenience the pricing and because i did purchase some items which i very much liked and thought of as good buys  today however i received a huge multicooker  airfryer pot instead of the dualbasket windowed airfryer i actually purchased  but thats not all  when i phoned amazon they asked me for a copy of my identification in order to process a return and refund  whaaaaat  you mean to tell me that in their utter incompetence they send me crappy items and then they want to ransom my refund because maybe they think i am trying to put myself through the hassle and frustration of dealing with a return  how absurd is that  oh and more so because the air fryer i actually ordered and was expecting is cheaper than the multicooker pot thing they sent me  soooo what is the angle in regard to this refund that would require my id so as to return a more expensive item  facedesk   i literally loathe this company now and hope that something comes along quickly that can upend them and show them how its done  i know thats a pipedream however because think of it  bezos is using all this money that pours in daily to invest  those returns on investment make him rich  it doesnt matter that an item arrives broken or badly manufactured or leaking or doesnt work or if its just the wrong item  the funds we paid for them are in his pocket at the time creating more money for him  what a formula
amazon equals dumpster fire amazon has turned into a dumpster fire the amount of times i get a delivery attempt was made but really wasnt not to mention just straight up stealing packages marked delivered this happens so often that parodies are made on social platforms about amazon employees stealing and forget getting customer service support they end up treating you like the criminal my daughter and i have already discussed not ordering expensive items via amazon especially with the holidays coming up things tend to never reach us
people dont buy anything at amazon people dont buy anything at amazon because there is absolute no contact possible when something went wrong with your orderand believe me very regular things go really wrong there you think that you buy something in your countrypar example i bought a dutch book at amazon from a dutch seller i receive the book without cover and in german language i get not on a normal way contact with the seller everything is at the platform amazon and via ai chatgpt so its very frustrating  i was weeks busy with sending back this wrong productv and i must pay the retourcosts wtf  really  are you freaking serious be warned for this miserable organisation 
this review is about amazon deliveries this review is about amazon deliveries not shoppingyou can write all the deliveries instruction you want the drivers cannot read i hace cancelled and 70000 delivery after they tried to deliver to a business office after five oçlock on a friday unfortunately it is not the first time and it will happen again
the worst customer service i tried to contact amazon customer service several times regarding the emails they send about order delivery absolutely useless they barely speak english and cant understand what i say to them i tried to find the email address i could contact them with no such luck one email i found bounced back and they provided their stupid categories for help which are useless there is never a category i need why we cant enter our own category i dont understand they should be ashamed making so much money and not providing decent customer service
ordered item yesterday not delivered as stated ordered item yesterday said would be delivered by 1 pm today then today it says between 5 and 9 pm why tell lies  its not the first time this has happened  quick enough to take the money then delay the products 
all of a sudden after years with all of a sudden after years with amazon they arbitrarily decided that they need some kind of verification for the debit card i have been using for years i am cancelling everything i can with this company they have done nothing but complicate my purchasing no more amazon for me
they did not refund me money that was they did not refund me money that was charged from unknown accountsupport dont speak english literally
looking at reviews seems amazon has gone downhill  judging by recent reviews it seems amazon service is  a taking a downhill trend ordered something simple a two piece loveseat for a studio apartment they delivered  two of the same parts not usable as a sofa customer service wont pick up til 20 th after speaking to a  lead its now the 19 th now i have to store their mistake for almost 3 weeks as well as try to arrange a replacement which will clearly be thru another business paid for the service of having it brought to my door paid for nothing now they want me to somehow get it down the flights of stairs from my condo on my own to the  garbage or take it to ups  only other option given im a prime member in two countries that buys for three residences management couldnt resolve issue

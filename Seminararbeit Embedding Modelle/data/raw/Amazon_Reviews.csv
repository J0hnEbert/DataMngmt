I sent them over. They said they would review them within 24 hours. In reality, it's been a week, and no one can help or give any (truthful) estimate of when it will be resolved; they just tell me to 'wait.' I've never seen such a horrible marketplace in my life. I hope those who came up with this can't buy food in a store, receiving a 'document review request' that takes forever to process.","September 16, 2024"

I cancelled my Amazon Prime in February and subsequently found that they had continued to charge me. When I contacted them they refused to give details of who had set up the payment as I didn't have Prime membership at that time.

I've had several orders never delivered and they always ask if I ""checked neighbor's homes"" etc. This is not my responsibility. My last missing order actually says the driver handed it to the resident. I live alone and was at work at the time of the delivery. They insisted that I need to wait another 24 hours to see if it mysteriously shows up. If it was still coming why do I have a tracking that says the delivery was handed to me? They are also very inconsistent with delivery times. When you call customer service they just don't care. This company is not standing behind its products or deliveries. It's time another company jumps in the game with good customer service.","September 06, 2024"

I strongly advise against leaving items unattended; it creates unnecessary risk. They continue to make promises and apologies, saying it won't happen again, yet the same issues persist. The information in the app often doesn't match reality. I placed an order, but there has been no update on my delivery, despite my follow-up inquiries.

I placed an order for a 16"" duct, which was crucial for one of our ongoing projects. The order came with a guaranteed delivery date that Amazon failed to meet. After several unsuccessful attempts to reach Amazon (with no accessible customer service contact numbers or direct support options), I was forced to contact the third-party seller directly. The seller assured me that the product had been dispatched on time and advised me to resolve the issue with Amazon. Despite being provided with a phone number that I could not find anywhere on Amazon’s platform, I eventually managed to speak with an Amazon representative. I was informed that the product had been lost, and while a refund was issued, the real issue remains unresolved.I need the material, not just a refund. When I attempted to reorder the product, I discovered that the price had increased by $150 — an unjustifiable increase given the circumstances. I explained the situation to the representative, emphasizing that I had already quoted my customer the original price and could not go back to them with an unexplained price hike. In summary, my experience with Amazon has been one of misleading pricing, unreliable delivery, and a lack of customer support. This has caused significant delays for my business and damaged my relationship with my customer.I expect Amazon to resolve this by honoring the original price and ensuring the prompt delivery of the product.Sincerely,  Alex Garcia  Attic Crawl Inc.","September 16, 2024"

In the years, the service has increased in price. Something else I noticed since lockdown: I can find most items I buy on Amazon cheaper elsewhere even when I include shipping. The only advantage Prime has is the speed of delivery (most of the time I can get it next day) pretty soon, it won’t be worth it: Disappointed. ","September 07, 2024"

However, my daughter has used Amazon consistantly, being reasonably satisfied. However, experience this week has changed her opinion. She ordered a Power Washer. When it arrived, the cardboard box it was in appeared to have been opened and very roughly resealed. On opening the box, two of the main components were missing, namely the gun and handle. On phoning Amazon, we were told that we had to deal directly with the supplier. Complaining about this, after over 40 minutes on the phone, we got a promise of a refund. We asked for that to be confirmed in an email. Email arrived stating we had to deal directly with supplier! Phoned back but got nowhere. You would have thought that, considering the disgraceful condition the Washer was delivered in, Amazon would have wanted to be involved.","September 08, 2024"

The street I live in is ..... Street leading to ...... street  hence there is 2 streets with the same door number.  The delivery drivers get confused and often deliver it to the wrong house.  I have gone to the other house in numerous occasions and been advised they do not have any parcels for me.  The photos of the delivery are not even of my property or that of the other house with the same number.  im sure the drivers have stock photos.. Anyway.  upon contacting Amazon I am more or less accused of steeling due to the amount of missed parcels and me requesting refunds or replacement.  I received an email with their return policy.  Again making me out to be an untruthful person and basically i found this quite offensive.  I reluctantly purchase  from them now and receive delivery to a locker ensuring that I receive them.  The 2 nearest lockers are in the Co-op shops that close at 9.00pm. This can be difficult to do when you work shifts.  Basically my complaint is the delivery drivers need to take more care.  Plus, Amazon should look into this and not accuse customers of being untruthful. ... Rant Over.. Sorry !!!","September 11, 2024"

Since COVID the delivery service has got worse and worse. You pay for prime, you get promised 2 day/ next day delivery when you make your transaction. Then it’s delay here new delivery date. You contact customer support all you get is we are sorry. When will customer service understand I don’t want your “we are sorry” I paid a premium cost for a service and you did not provide. Why am I not refunded my prime membership if you cannot deliver on your promise. What I have to do is wait till the package eventually turns up. The service has got more expensive and and less reliable.  Need Walmart and the likes to pick up and take the crown. Amazon is not the cheapest so I’m paying more anyway companies just need to deliver on there promises and I’m jumping. I’m not loyal to Amazon anymore they treat customers like cash cows.","September 07, 2024"

I get an error when I check refund status and refund cannot be processed.  I call multiple times including talk to so called supervisors that cannot fix this issue and process my refund.  I am getting sick of not getting this resolved and no one from Amazon can fix their auto generated refund system to refund my return.  Amazon makes sure to charge you the minute it ships out but does not care enough for their customer service to refund when it is shipped back.  I am highly disappointed with Amazons lack to help get me my refund due to their computer glitch.,"August 31, 2024"

That became less-so when they continued to send me items which were used/returned, BROKEN (literally), leaking, non-working, and just plain THE WRONG ITEM!  Still, I shopped them for the convenience, the pricing, and because I did purchase some items which I very much liked and thought of as good buys.  TODAY, however, I received a HUGE multi-cooker / air-fryer POT instead of the DUAL-basket, windowed air-fryer I actually purchased.  But, that's not all.  When I phoned Amazon, they asked me for a copy of my IDENTIFICATION in order to process a return and refund.  Whaaaaat?  You mean to tell me that in their utter incompetence, THEY send me crappy items and THEN they want to RANSOM my refund because (maybe?) they think I am trying to put myself through the hassle and frustration of dealing with a return????  HOW absurd is that?  OH, and more so because the Air Fryer I actually ordered and was expecting, is CHEAPER than the multi-cooker pot thing they sent me.  Soooo, what is the angle in regard to this refund that would require my ID so as to return a MORE EXPENSIVE item?  /facedesk  ... I literally loathe this company now, and hope that something comes along quickly that can upend them and show them how it's done.  I know that's a pipedream, however, because think of it:  Bezos is using ALL this money that POURS in daily, to INVEST.  Those returns on investment make him RICH.  It doesn't matter that an item arrives broken, or badly manufactured, or leaking, or doesn't work, or if it's just the wrong item.  The funds we paid for them are in his pocket at the time. creating more money for him.  What a formula!","September 13, 2024"
